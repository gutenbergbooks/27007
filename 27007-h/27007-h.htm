<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>LORD HALIFAX AND MRS. CATHERINE BARTON.</h3>

  <p>Those who have written on the life of Newton have touched with the
  utmost reserve upon the connexion which existed between his half-niece
  Catherine Barton, and his friend Charles Montague, who died Earl of
  Halifax. They seem as if they were afraid that, by going fairly into the
  matter, they should find something they would rather not tell. The
  consequence is, that when a writer at home or abroad, Voltaire or
  another, hints with a sneer that a pretty niece had more to do with
  Newton's appointment to the Mint than the theory of gravitation, those
  who would like to know as much as can be known of the whole truth find
  nothing in any attainable biography except either total silence or a very
  awkward and hesitating account of half something.</p>

  <p>On looking again into the matter, the juxtaposition of all the
  circumstances induced in my mind a strong suspicion that Mrs. C. Barton
  was <i>privately married</i> to Lord Halifax, probably before his
  elevation to the peerage, and that the marriage was no very great secret
  among their friends. As yet I can but say that the hypothesis of a
  private marriage is, to me, the most probable of those among which a
  choice must be made: farther information may be obtained by publication
  of the case in "N. &amp; Q.," the most appropriate place of deposit for
  the provisional result of unfinished inquiries.</p>

  <p>Charles Montague (born April, 1661, died May 19, 1715) made
  acquaintance with Newton when both were at Trinity College in 1680 and
  1681. Newton was nineteen years older than Montague, and had been twelve
  years Lucasian professor. At the beginning of their friendship, the
  Lucasian professor must be called the patron of the young undergraduate,
  who was looking for a fellowship with the intention of taking orders, a
  design which he did not find sufficient encouragement to abandon until
  after he had sat in the Convention. By 1690, the rising politician had
  become the patron of the author of the <i>Principia</i>, who in that <!--
  Page 430 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page430"></a>{430}</span>year
  or the next became an aspirant for public employment. The friendship of
  Newton and Montague lasted until the death of the latter, interrupted
  only by a coolness (on Newton's side at least) in 1691, arising out of a
  suspicion in Newton's mind that Montague was not sincere in his
  intentions towards his friend.</p>

  <p>Catherine Barton (born 1680, died 1739) was the daughter of Robert
  Barton and Newton's half-sister, Hannah Smith (Baily's <i>Flamsteed,
  Supplement</i>, p. 750.). Lieut.-Col. Barton, usually called her husband,
  was her brother. The pedigrees published by Turnor recognise this fact:
  Swift distinctly states it, and Rigaud proves it in various ways in
  letters to Baily, which lately passed through my hands on their way to
  the Observatory at Greenwich. The mistake ought never to have been made,
  for <i>Mrs. C. Barton</i> (as she was usually denominated) must,
  according to usage, have been reputed single so long as her Christian
  name was introduced.</p>

  <p>Mrs. C. Barton married Mr. Conduitt, then or afterwards Newton's
  assistant, and his successor: this marriage probably took place in 1718,
  the year in which Newton introduced Conduitt into the Royal Society.
  Among the Turnor memorials of Newton, now in possession of the Royal
  Society, is a watch leaving the inscription "Mrs. C. Conduitt to Sir
  Isaac Newton, January, 1708." This date cannot be correct, for Swift in
  1710, Halifax in 1712, Flamsteed in 1715, and Monmort in 1716, call her
  Barton: all but Flamsteed were intimate acquaintances. Any one who looks
  at the inscription will see that it is not as old as the watch: it is
  neither ornamented nor placed in a shield or other envelope, while the
  case is beautifully chased, and has an elaborate design, representing
  Fame and Britannia examining the portrait of Newton. Moreover, "Mrs.
  Conduitt" would never have described herself as "Mrs. C. Conduitt."</p>

  <p>Montague was not, so far as usual accounts state, what even in our day
  would be called a libertine. He married the Countess of Manchester (the
  widow of a relative) before his entry into public life, and was deeply
  occupied in party politics and fiscal administration. I am told that
  Davenant impugns his morals: this may be the exception which proves the
  rule; some of the lampoons directed against the Whig minister are
  preserved, and these do not attack his private character in the matter
  under allusion, so far as I can learn.</p>

  <p>All the cotemporary evidence yet adduced as to the relation between
  Lord Halifax and Catherine Barton, is contained in one sentence in the
  <i>Life</i> of the former, two codicils of his will, and one allusion of
  Flamsteed's. The <i>Life</i>, with the will attached, was appended to two
  different publications of the works of Halifax, in 1715 and 1716. The
  passage from the <i>Life</i> is as follows (p. 195.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I am likewise to account for another Omission in the Course of this
  History, which is that of the Death of the Lord <i>Halifax's</i> Lady;
  upon whose Decease his Lordship took a Resolution of living single thence
  forward, and cast his Eye upon the Widow of one Colonel <i>Barton</i>,
  and Neice to the famous Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>, to be Super-intendent of
  his domestick Affairs. But as this Lady was young, beautiful, and gay, so
  those that were given to censure, pass'd a Judgment upon her which she no
  Ways merited, since she was a Woman of strict Honour and Virtue; and tho'
  she might be agreeable to his Lordship in every Particular, that noble
  Peer's Complaisance to her, proceeded wholly from the great Esteem he had
  for her Wit and most exquisite Understanding, as will appear from what
  relates to her in his Will at the Close of these Memoirs."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This sentence is an insertion (the <i>first</i> omission is as far
  back as p. 64.). It speaks of Mrs. C. Barton as if she were dead: and it
  is worthy of note that this lady, who lived to communicate to Fontenelle
  materials for his <i>éloge</i> of Newton, had excellent opportunity, had
  it pleased her, to have contradicted or varied any part of the account
  given by Halifax's biographer; and this without appearing. The actual
  communication made to Fontenelle by her husband, Mr. Conduitt, is in
  existence, and was printed by Mr. Turnor; it contains no allusion to the
  subject. Farther, it appears by the biographer's account that she had
  passed as a widow, which is not to be wondered at: the <i>Colonel</i>
  Barton who was the son of circumstances, must have been created before
  her brother (who died in 1711) attained such rank, perhaps before he
  entered the army at all.</p>

  <p>The will gives very different evidence from that for which it is
  subp&oelig;naed: it is dated April 10, 1706. In the first codicil (dated
  April 12, 1706) Lord Halifax leaves Mrs. Barton all his jewels and
  3000<i>l.</i> "as a small token," he says, "of the great love and
  affection I have long had for her." In a second codicil (dated February
  1, 1712) the first codicil is revoked, and the bequest is augmented to
  5000<i>l.</i>, the rangership, lodge, and household furniture of Bushey
  Park, and the manor of Apscourt, for her life. These are given, says Lord
  Halifax, "as a token of the sincere love, affection, and esteem, I have
  long had for her person, and as a small recompense for the pleasure and
  happiness I have had in her conversation." In this same codicil "Mrs.
  Catherine Barton" is described as Newton's niece, and 100<i>l.</i> is
  left to Newton "as a mark of the great honour and esteem I have for so
  great a man." The concluding sentence of the codicil is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And I strictly charge and command my executor to give all aid, help,
  and assistance to her in possessing and enjoying what I have hereby given
  her; and also <!-- Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page431"></a>{431}</span>in doing any act or acts necessary to
  transfer her an annuity of two hundred pounds <i>per annum</i>, purchased
  in Sir Isaac Newton's name, which I hold for her in trust, as appears by
  a declaration of trust in that behalf."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This codicil immediately became the subject of remark, and the terms
  of it seem to have been understood as they would be now. Flamsteed,
  writing in July, 1715 (Halifax died in May), says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If common fame be true, he died worth 150,000<i>l.</i>; out of which
  he gave Mrs. Barton, Sir I. Newton's niece, for her <i>excellent
  conversation</i> [the Italics are Baily's, the original, I suppose,
  underlined], a curious house, 5000<i>l.</i> with lands, jewels, plate,
  money, and household furniture, to the value of 20,000<i>l.</i> or
  more."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I pay no attention to the statement that (<i>Biogr. Brit.</i>,
  Montague, note BB.) Lord Halifax was disappointed in a second marriage.
  It amounts only to this, that Lord Shaftsbury, having a certain lady in
  his heart and in his eye, was afraid he had a rival, and described the
  person talked of in terms which make it pretty certain that Halifax was
  intended. But it by no means follows that because a certain person is
  "talked of" for a lady, and a lover put in fear by the rumour, the person
  is really a rival: and not even a biographer would have shown himself so
  unfit for a novelist as to have drawn such a conclusion, unless he had
  been biassed by the wish to show that Halifax was attached to another
  than Mrs. Barton.</p>

  <p>It must of course be supposed that the introduction of Montague to
  Newton's niece was a consequence of his acquaintance with Newton, and
  took place in or near 1696, when Newton came to London, where his niece
  soon began to reside with him. And since, in 1706, the connexion,
  whatever it was, had been of long standing, we may infer that it had
  probably commenced in 1700. The case is then as follows. Montague
  received into his house, as "superintendent of his domestic affairs"
  after the death of his wife, the niece of his old and revered friend
  Newton, a conspicuous officer of the crown, a member of Parliament, and
  otherwise one of the most famous men living. This niece had been partly
  educated by Newton; she had lived in his house; we know of no other
  protector that she could have had, in London; and the supposition that
  she left any roof except Newton's to take shelter under that of Montague,
  would be purely gratuitous. She was unmarried, beautiful, and gay; and
  probably not so much as, certainly not much more then, twenty years old.
  A handsome annuity was bought for her in Newton's name, and held in trust
  by Halifax: if it had been bought <i>by Newton</i>, Conduitt would have
  mentioned it in his list of the benefactions which Newton's relatives
  received from him, especially after the publicity which it had obtained
  from Halifax's will. That she did not tenant the housekeeper's room while
  the friends of Halifax were round his table, may be inferred from the
  epigrams, poor as they are, which were made in her honour as a celebrated
  beauty and wit, in a collection of verses (reprinted in Dryden's
  <i>Miscellanies</i>) on the best known toasts of the day. Halifax
  bequeathed her a provision which might have suited his widow, in terms
  which must have been intended to show that she had been either his wife
  or his mistress; while in the same document he brought prominently
  forward his respect for Newton, the fact of her being Newton's niece, and
  the annuity which he had bought for her in Newton's name. An
  uncontradicted paragraph in the life of Halifax, published immediately
  after the will, and evidently not intended to bring forward any fact not
  perfectly well known, records her residence in the house of that nobleman
  and the consequent rumours concerning her character, affirms that she was
  a virtuous woman, and refers to the will to prove it: though the will
  denies it in the plainest English, on any supposition except that of a
  private marriage. Finally, the lady married a respectable man after the
  death of Lord Halifax, and lived with him in the house of her illustrious
  uncle.</p>

  <p>That she was either the wife or the mistress of Halifax, I take to be
  established; it is the natural conclusion from the facts above stated,
  all made public during her life, all left uncontradicted by herself, by
  her husband, by her daughter, by Lord Lymington her son-in-law, and by
  the uncle who had stood to her in the place of a father. It is impossible
  that Newton could have been ignorant that his niece was living in
  Montague's house, enjoyed an annuity bought in his own name, and was
  regarded by the world as the mistress of his friend and political patron.
  The language of the codicil shows that, be the nature of the connexion
  what it might, Halifax meant to tell the world that it might be
  proclaimed in all its relation to the name of Newton. To those who
  cannot, under all the circumstances, believe the connexion to have been
  what is called platonic, the probability that there was a private
  marriage is precisely the probability that Newton would not have
  sanctioned the dishonour of his own niece: and even if the connexion were
  only that of friendship, Newton must have sanctioned the appearance and
  the forms of a dishonourable intimacy: the co-habitation, the settlement,
  and the defiance of opinion. Now there is no reason to suppose of Newton
  that he would be a party to either proceeding, which would not apply as
  well to any man then alive: to Locke, for instance. Looking at the morals
  of the day, we are by no means justified in throwing off at once, with
  disgust, the bare idea of the possibility of a distinguished philosopher
  consenting to an illicit intercourse between his friend and his niece: we
  are bound, <!-- Page 432 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page432"></a>{432}</span>in discussing probabilities, to
  distinguish 1850 from 1700. But, even putting out of view the purity of
  Newton's private life, and of the lives of his most intimate friends,
  there is that in the weaker part of his character which is of itself
  almost conclusive. Right or wrong, Newton never faced opinion. As soon as
  he found that publication involved opposition, from that time forward he
  published only with the utmost reluctance, and under the strongest
  persuasions; except when, as in the case of some of his theological
  writings, he confided the manuscript to a friend, to be anonymously
  published abroad. The <i>Principia</i> was extorted from him by the Royal
  Society; the first publication on fluxions was under the name of Wallis;
  the <i>Optics</i> were delayed until the death of Hooke; the first
  appearance against Leibnitz was anonymous; the second originated in a
  hint from the King. This morbid fear, which is often represented as
  modesty, would have made him, had he acted a part with regard to his
  niece which he could not avow, conduct it with the utmost reserve. The
  philosopher who would have let the theory of gravitation die in silence
  rather than encounter the opposition which a discovery almost always
  creates, would not have allowed his <i>name</i> to be connected with the
  annuity which was the price of his niece's honour, or which carried all
  the appearance of it, even supposing him base enough to have connived at
  the purchase. And in such a case, Halifax would have taken care to
  respect the secrecy which he would have known to have been essential to
  Newton's comfort: he would not have published to the world that his
  mistress was Newton's niece, and that Newton was a party to a settlement
  upon her. There seems to me, about the codicil as it stands, a
  declaration that the connexion with Newton's niece was such as, if people
  knew all, Newton might have sanctioned. And the supposition of a private
  marriage, generally understood among the friends of the parties, seems to
  me to make all the circumstances take an air of likelihood which no other
  hypothesis will give them: and this is all my conclusion.</p>

  <p>If there were a marriage, the most probable reason for the concealment
  was, that it was contracted at a time when the birth and station of Mrs.
  Barton would have rendered her production at court as the wife of
  Montague an impediment to his career. He was raised to the peerage in
  1700, and as the connexion was of long standing in 1706, it may well be
  supposed that it commenced at the time when (in his own opinion at least)
  his prospects of such elevation might have been compromised by a decided
  misalliance. The lower the tone of morals, the greater the ridicule which
  attaches to unequal <i>marriages</i>. Montague, though of noble family,
  was the younger son of a younger son, and not rich: it was common among
  the Tories to sneer at him as a <i>parvenu</i>. He had made his first
  appearance in the great world as the husband of a countess-dowager, and
  it may be that the <i>parvenu</i> was weak enough to shrink from
  producing, as his second wife, a woman of very much lower rank, the
  granddaughter of a country clergyman, and the daughter of a man of no
  pretension to station. That Mr. Macaulay has not underrated the position
  of the country clergy, is known to all who have dipped into the writings
  of the seventeenth century. It is not, however, necessary to explain why
  the supposed marriage should have been private. As the world is
  constituted, no rules of inference can be laid down in reference to the
  irregular relations of the sexes.</p>

  <p>With reference to the insinuation that Newton owed his official
  position rather to his niece than to his ability, it can be completely
  shown that, on the worst possible supposition, the office in the Mint
  could have had nothing to do with Mrs. C. Barton. Newton was appointed to
  the lower office (the <i>Wardenship</i>) in March, 1695-96, when the
  young lady was not sixteen years old, and before she could have been a
  resident under her uncle's roof. The state of the coinage had caused much
  uneasiness; it was one of the difficulties, and its restoration was one
  of the successes, of the day. The best scientific advice was taken:
  Locke, Newton, and Halley were consulted, and all were placed in office
  nearly at the same time; Newton in the London Mint, Halley in the Chester
  Mint, Locke in the Council of Trade. Neither Locke nor Halley had any
  nieces. Before Newton's appointment there was some negociation of a
  public character: the Wardenship was not vacant, and the government seems
  to have tried to induce Newton to take something subordinate. March 14,
  Newton wrote to Halley, in reference to a current rumour,&mdash;"I
  neither put in for any place in the Mint, nor would meddle with Mr.
  Hoar's [the comptroller's] place, were it offered me." On the 19th,
  Montague informs Newton that he is to have the <i>Wardenship</i>, vacant
  by the removal of Mr. Overton to the Customs. Four years afterwards, when
  the great operation on the coinage, by many declared impracticable, had
  completely succeeded, Newton, a principal adviser and the principal
  administrator, obtained the Mastership in the course of promotion.
  Montague was raised to the peerage in the following year, and mainly, as
  the patent states, for the same service. So that, though Montague was the
  patron as to the Wardenship, yet scientific assistance was then so sorely
  needed, that no hypothesis relative to any niece would be necessary to
  explain the phenomenon of Newton's appointment: while, as to the
  Mastership it may almost be said that Montague was more indebted to
  Newton for his peerage, than Newton to Montague for that promotion which
  any minister must, under the circumstances, have granted. <!-- Page 433

  <p>In no account of Newton that I ever read is it stated that Mrs. Barton
  was an intimate friend of Swift, probably through Halifax. Having been
  told that there is frequent mention of her in Swift's <i>Journal to
  Stella</i>, I examined that series and the rest of the correspondence, in
  which her name occurs about twenty times. One letter from herself, under
  the name of Conduitt (November 29, 1733), is indorsed by the Dean, "My
  old friend Mrs. Barton, now Mrs. Conduitt," and establishes the identity
  of Swift's friend with Newton's niece: otherwise, it proves nothing here.
  The other points to be noticed are as follows.</p>

  <p>1710, September 28, November 30, March 7; 1711, April 3, July 18,
  October 14 and 25, Swift visited or dined with Mrs. Barton at her
  <i>lodgings</i>. He was also at this time on good terms with Halifax, and
  dined with him November 28, 1710, and with Mrs. Barton on November 30.
  According to the idiom of the day, <i>lodgings</i> was a name for every
  kind of residence, and even for the apartments of a guest in the house of
  his host. For anything to the contrary in the mere word, the lodgings
  might have been in the house of Lord Halifax, or of Newton himself. But,
  on the other hand, the future Dean, much as he writes to Stella of every
  kind of small talk, never mentions Halifax and Mrs. Barton together,
  never makes the slightest allusion to either in connexion with the other,
  though in one and the same letter he minutes his having dined with
  Halifax on the 28th, and with Mrs. Barton on the 30th. There must have
  been intentional suppression in this. All the world knew that there was
  some <i>liaison</i> between the two; yet when Swift (1711, Nov. 20)
  records his having been "teased with whiggish discourse" by Mrs. Barton,
  he does not even drop a sarcasm about her politics having been learnt
  from Halifax. This is the more remarkable as the two seem to have been
  almost the only persons who are mentioned as talking whiggery to him. To
  this list, however, may be added Lady Betty Germain, well known to the
  readers of Swift's poetry, who joined Mrs. Barton in inflicting the
  vexation, and at whose house the conversation took place. It thus appears
  that Mrs. Barton was received in a manner which shows that she was
  regarded as a respectable woman. The suppression on the part of Swift may
  indicate respect for his two friends (that he highly respected Mrs.
  Barton appears clear), and observance of a convention established in
  their circle. But perhaps it is rather to be attributed to his own
  position with respect to Stella, which was certainly peculiar, though no
  one can say what their understanding was at the date of the journal. This
  journal came again into Swift's hands before it was published; so that we
  can only treat it as containing what he finally chose to preserve.
  Allusions may have been struck out.</p>

  <p>There is another point which our modern manners will not allow to be
  very closely handled in print, but on which I am disposed to lay some
  stress. On September 28, 1710, and April 3, 1711, Swift visited Mrs.
  Barton at her lodgings. On each of these occasions she regaled him with a
  good story, which there is no need to repeat: there is no harm in either,
  and they are far from being the most singular communications which he
  made to Stella; but they go beyond what, even in that day, will be
  considered as the probable conversation of a maiden lady of thirty-one,
  with a bachelor man of the world of forty-three. But they by no means
  exceed what we know to be the license then taken by married women; and
  Swift's tone with respect to the stories, combined with his obvious
  respect for Mrs. Barton, may make any one lean to the supposition that he
  believed himself to be talking to a married woman.</p>

  <p>The reserve of Swift puts us quite at fault as to the locality of Mrs.
  Barton's <i>lodgings</i>. They may have been in Lord Halifax's house; but
  if not, it requires some supposition to explain why they were not in that
  of Newton, with whom she had lived, and with whom she certainly lived
  after the death of Halifax. Perhaps, when farther research is made in
  such directions as may be indicated by the only unreserved statement of
  the existing case which has ever been printed, the conclusion I arrive
  at, as to me the <i>most probable</i>, may either be reinforced, or
  another substituted for it. Be this as it may, such points as I have
  discussed, relating to such men as Newton, will not remain in abeyance
  for ever, let biographers be as timid as they will.</p>

<h3>DR. PARR ON MILTON.</h3>

  <p>Amongst my autographs I find the inclosed letter frown Dr. Parr. It is
  written upon a half-sheet of paper, and in a very cramp and illegible
  hand. To whom it is addressed, or when written, I am unable to say. As it
  relates to the opinions held by Milton, perhaps you may think it worth
  insertion in your work, particularly as Milton has been the subject of
  some papers in "N. &amp; Q." lately.</p>

  <p>Dear Sir,</p>

  <p>I send you Johnson's <i>Life of Milton</i>. My former feelings again
  return upon me, that Johnson did not mean to affirm that Milton prayed
  not upon any occasion or in any manner; but that he was engaged in no
  visible worship; that he prayed at no stated time; that he had not what
  we may call any regular return of family or private devotion. Pray read
  the sequel. That he lived without prayer can hardly be affirmed, this
  <!-- Page 434 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  wear the appearance of contradiction to the former passage, that omitting
  public prayer he omitted all; in truth, the expression just quoted is too
  peremptory and too general. But the sense of Johnson cannot be mistaken,
  if you attend to the different views he had in each sentence; and I
  repeat my former assertion, that Johnson did not think Milton destitute
  of a devout spirit, or totally negligent of prayer in some form or
  other.</p>

<h3>PARTS OF MSS.</h3>

  <p>As an instance of the unfortunate dispersion of the parts of valuable
  MSS. through different countries, occasioned probably, in the case now to
  be mentioned, by public convulsions and the wild fury of revolutionary
  mobs in France, will you afford me space to quote an interesting
  description of a MS. from the catalogue of a library to be sold at Paris
  in December next? The MSS. and printed books in this library belonged to
  the eminent bookseller J.&nbsp;J. De Bure, whose ancestor was the
  distinguished and well-known bibliographer Guillaume de Bure. The
  publicity given to descriptions like the present through the medium of
  "N. &amp; Q." may ultimately lead, on some occasions, to the scattered
  volumes being brought together again, either by way of purchase, or in
  exchange for other works.</p>

<h3>WILLIAM BLAKE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> p. 71.)</p>

  <p>I venture to send you another Note regarding William Blake, claiming
  for that humble individual the honour of being the pioneer in the
  establishment of charity-schools in Britain, from which department of our
  social system who can calculate the benefits accrued, and constantly
  accruing, to this country!</p>

  <p>We look in vain through the <i>Silver Drops</i> of William Blake for
  any record of an existing institution, such as he would have his "noble
  ladies" rear at Highgate. Among the many incentives he uses to prompt the
  charitable, we do not find him holding up for their example any model
  (unless it be "Old Sutton's brave hospital"); in all his amusing
  "Charity-school Sticks," his tone is that of a man trying to persuade
  people that the thing he proposes is feasible. "Some of them," says the
  sanguine Blake, "have scarce faith enough to believe in the success of
  this great and good design. Nay, your brother Cornish himself," continues
  he, in addressing one of his ladies, although full of good works, "would
  have persuaded me to lay it down" upon the ground of its
  impracticability. The language of Blake is everywhere advocating this
  "<i>new</i> way of charity." "If it be <i>new</i>," says he to an
  objector, "the more's the pity;" and, with reference to the possibility
  of failure, he would thus shame them into liberality. Speaking of his
  "fine, handsome, and well cloathed boys; not too fine, because they are
  the ladies'!" our enthusiast adds to this <i>soft sawdur</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But now, if a year or two hence they should be grown, which God
  forbid! poor ragged, half-starved, and no cloaths, country folks would
  say, who ride or go that way, Were there not good ladies enough in and
  about London to maintain <i>one</i> little school?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here then is <i>primâ facie</i> evidence, I think, that my subject,
  poor crazy William Blake, was the originator of one of the greatest
  social improvements of modern times.</p>

  <p>The charity-school movement had obtained a strong hold upon the public
  mind early in the past century; but although I have sought for the name
  of Blake through many books professing to give an account of the early
  history of such institutions, I have not yet met with the slightest
  allusion to him, his school, or his <i>Silver Drops</i>.</p>

  <p>The superficial inquirer into the history of English charity-schools
  will be told that the honour of the first erecting such, and caring for
  destitute children, is popularly considered due to the parishes of St.
  Botulph, Aldgate, and St. Margaret's, Westminster: and if he would
  farther satisfy himself upon that point, he will see it claimed by the
  first named; a slab in front of their schools, adjoining the Royal Mint,
  bearing an inscription to the purport that it was the first Protestant
  charity-school, erected by voluntary contributions in 1693.</p>

  <p>If it comes to the earliest London school for poor children, perhaps
  the Catholics take the lead; for we find that it was part of the tactics
  of the Jesuits, in the reign of James II., to promote their design of
  subverting the Protestant religion by infusing their Romish tenets into
  the minds of the children of the poor by providing schools for them in
  the Savoy and Westminster.</p>

  <p>Blake says, with reference to this movement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That the scheme he was engaged upon was a good work, because it will
  in some measure stop the mouths of Papists, who are prone to say, Where
  are your works, and how few are your hospitals, and how small is your
  charity, notwithstanding your great preaching?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>A remarkable little book, and a very fit companion for the <i>Silver
  Drops</i> of William Blake, to which it bears a striking similarity, is
  the <i>Pietas Hallensis</i> of Dr. Franck. In this, the German divine
  relates, in a style which bears more than an accidental resemblance to
  the work of the Covent Garden Philanthropist, how, little by little, by
  importunity and perseverance, he nursed his own charitable plans, of a
  like kind, into full life and vigour; and both Drs. Woodward and Kennett
  endorse and command the "miraculous footsteps of Divine Providence" in
  the labours of Dr. Franck. "Could we," says Dr. Kennett, "trace the
  obscurer footsteps of our own charity-schools, the finger of God would be
  as evidently in them." Why the Bishop of Peterborough should be ignorant
  of these earlier efforts to the same end in his own country, is somewhat
  marvellous. Franck began his charitable work at Glaucha in 1698; while
  Blake was labouring to establish his Highgate School in 1685. That Franck
  should know nothing about our pioneer in charitable education, is
  probable enough; but that the English divines I have mentioned, with
  Wodrow, Gillies, and a host of others, should be unaware that the
  proceedings at Halle were only the counterpart of those done fourteen
  years before by Blake in their own land, is certainly surprising, and
  affords another proof of the proneness of Britons to extol everything
  foreign to the neglect of what is native and at their own doors.</p>

  <p>Perhaps some of your readers will think I over-estimate the importance
  of the question, whether the charity-school movement is of British or
  foreign growth; or whether the honour of its application to the poor (for
  all <i>charity</i>-schools are not for such) belongs to my subject
  William Blake, or <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page436"></a>{436}</span>some other philanthropic individual; if
  such there be, let them repair to our Metropolitan Cathedral on the day
  of the annual assemblage of the London charity children: and if, on
  contemplating the spectacle which will there meet their eye, they do not
  think it an object of interest to discover who, as Dr. Kennett says,
  "first cast in the <i>salt</i> at the fountain-head to heal the
  <i>waters</i>, and broke the ground that was before barren," I pity
  them.</p>

  <p>In concocting this Note, I have had before me the following:</p>

  <p>1. Lysons's <i>Environs of London</i>, 1795, where will be found a
  short notice of Blake. The author, following Gough, makes my subject a
  madman, and says his scheme "failed after laying out 5000<i>l.</i> upon
  it."</p>

  <p>2. <i>Sermon preached for Charity-schools</i>, by Dr. Kennett,
  1706.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Sermons of Dr. Smalridge and T. Yulden</i>, 1710 and 1728. These
  divines give the precedence to Westminster School, "erected 1688."</p>

  <p>4. <i>Wodrow's Letters</i>, edited by Dr. M<sup>c</sup>Crie, 3 vols.,
  Edin. 1843.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Pietas Hallensis</i>: or an Abstract of the Marvellous Footsteps
  of Divine Providence, in the building of a very large Hospital, or rather
  a Spacious College, for Charitable and Excellent Uses; and in the
  maintaining of many Orphans, and other Poor People therein at Glaucha,
  near Halle in Prussia, related by the Rev. A.&nbsp;H. Franck, 3 parts, 12mo.,
  London, 1707-16. Let the curious reader compare this with Blake's
  book.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Legends of the County Clare.</i>&mdash;About nine miles westward
  from the town of Ennis, in the midst of some of the wildest scenery in
  Ireland, lies the small but very beautiful Lake of Inchiquin, famous
  throughout the neighbouring country for its red trout, and for being in
  winter the haunt of almost all the various kinds of waterfowl, including
  the wild swan, that are to be found in Ireland, while the woods that
  border one of its sides are amply stocked with woodcocks. At one
  extremity of the lake are the ruins of the Castle of Inchiquin, part of
  which is built on a rock projecting into the lake, there about one
  hundred feet deep, and this legend is related of the old
  castle:&mdash;Once upon a time, the chieftain of the Quins, whose
  stronghold it was, found in one of the caves (many of which are in the
  limestone hills that surround the lake) a lady of great beauty, fast
  asleep. While gazing on her in rapt admiration she awoke, and, according
  to the customs of the Heroic Age, soon consented to become his bride,
  merely stipulating that no one bearing the name of O'Brien should be
  allowed to enter the castle gate: this being agreed to, the wedding was
  celebrated with all due pomp, and in process of time one lovely boy
  blessed their union. Among the other rejoicings at the birth of an heir
  to the chief of the clan, a grand hunting-match took place, and the chase
  having terminated near the castle, the chieftain, as in duty bound,
  requested the assembled nobles to partake of his hospitality. To this a
  ready assent was given, and the chiefs were ushered into the great hall
  with all becoming state; and then for the first time did their host
  discover that one bearing the forbidden name was among them The banquet
  was served, and now the absence of the lady of the castle alone delayed
  the onslaught on the good things spread before them. Surprised and half
  afraid at her absence, her husband sought her chamber: on entering, he
  saw her sitting pensively with her child at the window which overlooked
  the lake; raising her head as he approached, he saw she was weeping, and
  as he advanced towards her with words of apology for having broken his
  promise, she sprang through the window with her child into the lake. The
  wretched man rushed forward with a cry of horror: for one moment he saw
  her gliding over the waters, now fearfully disturbed, chanting a wild
  dirge, and then, with a mingled look of grief and reproach, she
  disappeared for ever! And the castle and the lordship, with many a broad
  acre besides, passed from the Quins, and are now the property of the
  O'Briens to this day; and while the rest of the castle is little better
  than a heap of ruins, the fatal window still remains nearly as perfect as
  when the lady sprang through it, an irrefragable proof of the truth of
  the legend in the eyes of the peasantry.</p>

  <p><i>The Seven Whisperers.</i>&mdash;I have been informed by an old and
  trustworthy servant that about twenty years ago, as he was walking one
  clear starlight night with two other persons, they heard, for the space
  of several minutes, high up in the air, beautiful sounds like music,
  which gradually died away towards the north. He spoke of it as an
  occurrence not very uncommon, and said it was always called "The Seven
  Whisperers." On inquiry I found the name well known amongst the poorer
  classes.</p>

<h3>ITALIAN-ENGLISH, GERMAN-ENGLISH, AND THE REFUGEE STYLE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 149.)</p>

  <p>Every one has admired the odd bits of Italian-English which "N. &amp;
  Q." lately published, a true <!-- Page 437 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page437"></a>{437}</span>philological curiosity. Such queer medleys
  have been the result whenever two opposite idioms have been thrown
  together and unskilfully stirred up. Very few foreigners indeed,
  Sclavonic nations being excepted, and particularly the Russians, write
  French tolerably well. The present Lord Mahon and Lady Montaigne, in an
  excellent <i>Essay on Marriage</i>, are exceptions to the rule. Voltaire
  used to say,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Faites tous vos vers à Paris;</p>
      <p>Et n'allez pas en Allemagne!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And very right he was. His kingly disciple committed more than once
  such Irish rhymes as these:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Je vais cueillir dans leurs sentiers (des Muses)</p>
      <p>De fraîches et charmantes roses;</p>
      <p>Et je dédaigne les lauriers,</p>
      <p>En exceptant les lauriers <i>sauces</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Forgetting the difference of pronunciation between the soft <i>s</i>
  of <i>rose (roze)</i> and the lisping sound of the <i>c</i> in <i>sauce
  (sôss)</i>. As I have not by me the ponderous and voluminous works of the
  poetical monarch, I may have altered some of the words of the quotation;
  but the rhymes <i>sauce</i> and <i>rose</i> I aver to be true to the
  primitive copy. Even Protestant refugees, born of French parents, brought
  up amongst their co-religionists and countrymen, wrote a strange
  gibberish, often ungrammatical, always unidiomatic, of which traces may
  be found even in Basnage and Ancillon. A recent French theologian, the
  clever author of a Life of Spinosa, written in Germany and published in
  Paris with some success, has such expressions as these:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Les villes protestantes preferent la liberté avec Calvin <span
  class="scac">QUE</span> la tyrannique concorde avec
  Luther."&mdash;<i>Hist. Crit. du Rationalisme</i>, p. 49.</p>

  <p>"Et ailleuz: Stuttgard Dontil etait conservateur <span class="scac">DE
  LA</span> Bibliothèque."-<i>Ib</i>.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And M. Amand Saintes is a Frenchman, and a most erudite man. The
  Celebrated Frau Bettina von Arnim, who dared to translate into English
  and to print in Berlin (apud Trowitzsch and Son, 1838), under the new
  title of <i>Diary of a Child</i>, her own untranslateable letters to
  Göthe, had at least the very good excuse of her nationality for her
  peculiar English, the choicest, funniest, maddest, and saddest English
  ever penned on this planet or in any other, and of which I hope "N. &amp;
  Q." will accept some small specimens, taken at random among thousands
  such. To begin with the opening address:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"<i>To the English Bards</i>.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen!&mdash;The noble cup of your mellifluous tongue so often
  brimmed with immortality, here filled with odd but pure and fiery
  draught, do not refuse to taste if you relish its spirit to be homefelt,
  though not home-born."</p>

<p class="cenhead">"<span class="sc">Bettina Arnim</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We will next pass to the "Preamble":</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The translating of Göthe's Correspondence with a Child into English
  was generally disapproved of. Previous to its publication in Germany, the
  well-renowned Mrs. Austin, by regard for the great German poet, proposed
  to translate it; but after having perused it with attention, the literate
  and the most famed bookseller of London thought unadvisable the
  publication of a book that in every way widely differed from the spirit
  and feelings of the English, and therefore it could not be depended upon
  for exciting their interest. Mrs. Austin, by her gracious mind to comply
  with my wishes, proposed to publish some fragments of it, but as no
  musician ever likes to have only those passages of his composition
  executed that blandish the ear, I likewise refused my assent to the
  maiming of a work, that not by my own merit, but by chance and nature
  became a work of art, that only in the untouched development of its
  genius might judiciously be enjoyed and appraised."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Our next and last is taken from p. 133.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"From those venturesome and spirit-night-wanderings I came home with
  garments wet with melted snow; they believed I had been in the garden.
  When night I forgot all; on the next evening at the same time it came
  back to my mind, and the fear too I had suffered; I could not conceive,
  how I had ventured to walk alone on that desolate road in the night, and
  to stay on such a waste dreadful spot; I stood leaning at the court gate;
  to-day it was not so mild and still as yesterday; the gales rose high and
  roared along; they sighed up at my feet and hastened on yonder side, the
  fluttering poplars in the garden bowed and flung off their snow-burden,
  the clouds drove away in a great hurry, what rooted fast wavered yonder,
  and what could ever be loosened, was swept away by the hastening
  breezes." (!!!).</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Meaning of "Delighted" in some Places of Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;I am
  sorry to be obliged to differ so often in opinion with H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K., but as
  we are both, I trust, solely actuated by the love of truth, he no doubt
  will excuse me. My difference now with him is about "<i>delighted</i>
  spirit," by which he understands the "tender <i>delicate</i> spirit,"
  while I take it to be the "<i>delectable</i>" or "<i>delightful</i>
  spirit." As I think this is founded on the Latin, I beg permission to
  quote the following portion of my note on Jug. ii. 3. in my edition of
  Sallust:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Incorruptus</i>, <span title="aphthartos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F04;&phi;&theta;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> ,
  <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> incapable of dissolution, the <i>incorruptibilis</i> of the
  Fathers of the Church. In imitation probably of the Greek verbal
  adjective in <span title="tos" class="grk">&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  as <span title="hairetos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F31;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, <span
  title="streptos" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&rho;&epsilon;&pi;&tau;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span>, etc., the
  Latins, especially Sallust, sometimes used the past part. as equivalent
  to an adj. in <i>bilis</i>: comp. xliii, 5.; lxxvi. 1.; xci. 7.; Cat.
  <span class="scac">I</span>. 4.,</p>

<p><!-- Page 438 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page438"></a>{438}</span></p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is in this sense that <i>flexus</i> is to be understood in Virg.
  <i>Æn.</i>, v. 500."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same employment of the past part. is frequent in our old English
  writers, and I rather think that they adopted it from the Latin. The
  earliest instance which I find in my notes is from Golding, who renders
  the <i>tonitrus et inevitabile fulmen</i> of Ovid (<i>Met.</i> <span
  class="scac">III</span>. 301.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"With dry and dreadful thunderclaps and lightning to the same,</p>
      <p>Of deadly and <i>unavoided</i> dint."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In Milton I have noticed the following participles used in this sense:
  <i>unmoved</i>, <i>abhorred</i>, <i>unnumbered</i>, <i>unapproached</i>,
  <i>dismayed</i>, <i>unreproved</i>, <i>unremoved</i>, <i>unsucceeded</i>,
  <i>preferred</i>. But as Milton was addicted to Latinising, I will give
  some examples from Shakspeare himself:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now thou art come unto a feast of death</p>
      <p>A terrible and <i>unavoided</i> danger."&mdash;<i>1 Hen. VI.</i>, Act IV. Sc. 5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"We see the very wreck that we must suffer,</p>
      <p>And <i>unavoided</i> the danger now,</p>

      <p class="hg3">"O, <i>undistinguished</i> space of woman's will."&mdash;<i>Ib.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I could give instances from Spenser and even from Pope, but shall only
  observe that when we say "an <i>undoubted</i> fact" we mean an
  <i>indubitable</i> one.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Thos. Keightley.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;I am not disposed to quarrel with H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K.'s derivation of
  <i>awkward</i> (Vol. viii., p. 310.), but I must observe that the more
  exact correlative of <i>toward</i> seems to be <i>wayward</i>. The
  Anglo-Saxons appear to have pronounced their &#x21D; as <i>g</i>; but
  after the Conquest it was pronounced hard in some cases, and so
  <i>wayward</i> and <i>awkward</i> may have the same origin.</p>

  <p><i>Shakspeare Portrait.</i>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents state
  whether the sign of Shakspeare, said to have been painted at a cost of
  150<i>l.</i>, and which in 1764 graced a tavern then in Drury Lane,
  called "The Shakspeare," and in that year was taken down and removed into
  the country, and used for a similar purpose, still exists, add where? and
  is the artist who painted such known?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Charlecott.</span></p>

  <p><i>"Taming of the Shrew."</i>&mdash;I cannot help thinking that
  Christopher Sly merely means that he is fourteenpence on the score for
  <i>sheer</i> ale,&mdash;nothing but ale; neither bread nor meat, horse
  housing, or bed.</p>

  <p>He has <i>drunk</i> the entire amount, and glories in his iniquity,
  like a true tippler.</p>

  <p class="author">G. H. K.</p>

  <p><i>Lord Bacon and Shakspeare.</i>&mdash;Can any of those
  correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." who have devoted attention to the lives
  of two of England's greatest worthies, Francis Bacon and William
  Shakspeare, account for the extraordinary fact that, although these two
  highly gifted men were cotemporaries, no mention of or allusion to the
  other is to be found in the writings of either? Bacon was born in 1561,
  and died in 1626; Shakspeare, who was born in 1563, and died ten years
  before the great chancellor, not only loved</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy,"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>but breathes throughout every page of his wondrous writings a spirit
  of philosophy as profound as his imagination is unlimited; yet nowhere,
  it is believed, can he be traced as making the slight allusion to the
  great father of modern philosophy. Bacon, on the other hand, whom one can
  scarcely suppose to have been ignorant of the writings of the dramatist,
  but who indeed may rather be believed to have known him personally, seems
  altogether to ignore his existence, or the existence of any of his
  matchless works. As the solution of this problem could not but throw much
  light on that most interesting subject,&mdash;the history of the minds of
  Shakespeare and Bacon,&mdash;I venture to throw it out as a fit subject
  for the research of some of your contributors versed in the writings of
  these great spirits of their own age, no less than of all time.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Decomposed Cloth.</i>&mdash;In Mr. Wright's valuable work on <i>The
  Celt, the Roman, and the Saxon</i>, p. 308., is mentioned the discovery
  at York of a Roman coffin, in which were distinctly visible "the colour,
  a rich purple," as well as texture of the cloth with which the body it
  had contained had been covered.</p>

  <p>I should think that the colour observed was not that of the ancient
  dye, but rather was caused by phosphate of iron, formed by the
  combination of iron contained in the soil or water, with phosphoric acid,
  arising from the decomposition of animal matter. It may often be observed
  in similar cases, as about animal remains found in bogs, and about

  <p><i>First and Last.</i>&mdash;There cannot be two words more different
  in meaning than these, and yet they are both used to express the same
  sense! Of two authors equally eminent, one shall write that a thing is of
  the <i>first</i> and the other of the <i>last</i> importance, though each
  means the <i>greatest</i> or <i>utmost</i>. How is this? To me
  <i>first</i> appears preferable, though <i>last</i> may be justifiable.
  Being on the subject of words, I am reminded of <i>obnoxious</i>, which
  is applied in the strangest ways by different authors. It is true that
  the Roman writers used <i>obnoxius</i> in various senses; but it does not
  seem so pliable or smooth in English. Generally it is held to indicate
  <i>disagreeable</i> or <i>inimical</i>, though our dictionaries do not
  admit it to have either of those meanings!</p>

  <p><i>Cucumber Time.</i>&mdash;This term, which the working-tailors of
  England use to denote that which their masters call "the flat season,"
  has been imported from a country which periodically sends many hundreds
  of its tailors to seek employment in our metropolis. The German phrase is
  "Die saure Gurken Zeit," or pickled gherkin time. A misunderstanding of
  the meaning of the phrase may have given rise to the vulgar witticism,
  that tailors are vegetarians, who "live on cucumber" while at play, and
  on "cabbage" while at work.</p>

  to 1763, I shall be happy to place them in the hands of any descendant of

  <p><i>Boswell's "Johnson."</i>&mdash;In vol. v. p. 272. of <i>my</i>
  favourite edition, and p. 784. of the edition in one volume, Johnson,
  writing to Brocklesby, under date Sept. 2, 1784, calls Windham "inter
  stellas Luna minores." Boswell, in a note, says, "It is remarkable that
  so good a Latin scholar as Johnson should have been so inattentive to the
  metre, as by mistake to have written <i>stellas</i> instead of
  <i>ignes</i>." Now, with all due deference, a Captain of Native Infantry
  ventures to suggest that both <i>stellas</i> and <i>ignes</i> are wrong,
  and that Johnson was thinking of the noble opening of Horace's 15th
  Epode:</p>

  <p><i>Stage Coaches.</i>&mdash;It occurs to me as highly desirable that,
  before the recollection of the old stage coach has faded from the memory
  of all but the oldest inhabitant, an authentic statement should be placed
  on record of the length of the stages, and the speed that was obtained,
  by this mode of conveyance, in which England was for so many years
  without a rival.</p>

  <p>The speed of mail coaches is, I believe chronicled in the British
  Almanac of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge; but their
  speed, if I mistake not, was surpassed by that of the "Rival," which
  travelled (from Monmouth, I think) to London after the opening of the
  Great Western Railway.</p>

  <p>Could any of your correspondents favour us with the time-bill of that
  coach, detailing the length of the several stages, and the time of
  performance? It would also be interesting to chronicle the period during
  which this rivalry with the railway was maintained.</p>

  <p><i>Antecedents.</i>&mdash;The word "antecedents," as a plural, and in
  the sense attached to it by the French, is not to be found in any English
  dictionary that I have the means of consulting. And yet it seems now to
  be commonly used as an English expression, even by some of our best
  writers.</p>

  <p>When was this word first imported, and by whom? I have just met with
  an instance of it in Jerdan's <i>Autobiography</i>, vol. i. p. 131.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I got him (Hammon), with a full knowledge of his antecedents, into
  the employment of a humane and worthy wine merchant of Bordeaux."</p>

  <p><i>The Letter X.</i>&mdash;The letter X on brewers' casks is probably
  thus derived:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Simplex</i> = single x, or X.</p>
      <p><i>Duplex</i> = double x, or XX.</p>
      <p><i>Triplex</i> = treble x, or XXX.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This was suggested by Owen's <i>Epigram</i>, lib. xii. 34.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p><i>A Crow-bar.</i>&mdash;In Johnson's <i>Dictionary</i> the
  explanation given of this word is "piece of iron used as a lever to force
  open doors, as the Latins called a hook <i>corvus</i>." In Walters'
  <i>English and Welsh Dictionary</i>, the first part of which was
  published about the year 1770, this word is printed "<i>Croe</i>-bar." Is
  it probable that the word <i>crow</i> has been derived front the
  Camb.-Brit. word <i>cro</i>, a curve? and that the name has been given
  from the circumstance of one end of a crow-bar being curved for the
  purpose of making it more efficient as lever?</p>

  the original Query (Vol. viii., p. 174.), as the motto in question was

  was ordered to be <i>continued</i> in 1707, and to be <i>discontinued</i>
  (by an order in council) on the accession of the House of Hanover in
  1714, when the old motto "Dieu et mon droit" was resumed.</p>

  to receive holy confirmation; and this quite apart from any sectarian
  views on the matter. I should like to know if any of my <!-- Page 441
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page441"></a>{441}</span>clerical
  brethren have noticed the same superstition as I must call it. Labourers'
  wives in some cases have at once stated their being married as a valid
  objection; and in others their husbands, although Churchmen, have at once
  entered their <i>veto</i> on their being confirmed. Can it arise from any
  vague reminiscence of the practical rule of the Church of England on the
  subject, which has been so long ignored?</p>

  <p>"While King Haco lay in Ronaldsvo, a great darkness drew over the sun;
  so that only a little ring was bright round the sun, and it continued so
  for some hours."&mdash;P. 45.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>King Haco, according to the account, left Bergen on his expedition
  "three nights before the 'Selian' vigils ... with all his fleet," and,
  "having got a gentle breeze, was two nights at sea when he reached that
  harbour of Shetland called Breydeyiar Sound (Bressay Sound, I presume)
  with a great part of his navy." Here he remained "near half a month, and
  from thence sailed to the Orkneys; and continued some time at Elidarwick,
  which is near Kirkwall.... After St. Olave's wake (July 18, O.&nbsp;S.) King
  Haco, leaving Elidarwick, sailed south before the Mull of Ronaldsha, with
  all the navy;" and being joined by Ronald from the Orkneys, with the
  ships that had followed him, he "led the whole armament into Ronaldsha,
  which he left upon the vigil of St. Lawrence (July 30, O.&nbsp;S.)."</p>

  <p>Now I wish to know, 1. On what day in August this eclipse took place,
  the day of the week, commencement of the eclipse, &amp;c.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>Margaret Patten.</i>&mdash;I have just seen a curious old picture,
  executed at least a century ago, and which was lately found amongst some
  family papers. It is a half-length of an old woman in homely looking
  garments; a dark blue stuff gown, the sleeves partially rolled up, and
  white sleeving protruding from under, not unlike the fashion of to-day; a
  white and blue checked apron; around her neck a white tippet and a
  handkerchief, on her head a "mutch," or close linen cap, and a lace or
  embroidered band across her forehead to hide the absence of hair. She
  holds something undistinguishable in one hand.</p>

  <p>The picture is about 10 × 8 inches, and is done on glass, evidently
  transferred from an engraving on steel. The colours have been laid on
  with hand, and then, to preserve and make an opaque back, it has received
  a coating of plaster of Paris; altogether in its treatment resembling a
  coloured photograph.</p>

  <p>By-the-bye, I am sorry I could not get a copy (photographic) of it, or
  that would have rendered intelligible what I fear my lame descriptions
  cannot. Beneath the figure is the following inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"<span class="sc">Margaret Patten</span>,</p>

  <p>Born in the Parish of Lochnugh, near Pairsley in Scotland, now Liveing
  in the Work House of St. Marg<sup>ts</sup>, Westminsster, aged 138."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is no date appended.</p>

  <p>The word "Lochnugh" in the inscription is evidently spelt from the
  Scotch pronunciation of Lochwinnoch, near Paisley.</p>

  <p>I should be very glad if any of your readers or correspondents in
  London could ascertain if the name, &amp;c. is to be found in the records
  of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and also give me some facts as to the
  history of this poor old Scotch woman, left destitute so far from home
  and kindred.</p>

  Workhouse, aged 136." In Walcott's <i>Memorials of <!-- Page 443 --><span

  288., we are told "she was a native of Lochborough, near Paisley. She was
  brought to England to prepare Scotch broth for King James II., but, owing
  to the abdication of that monarch, fell into poverty and died in St.
  Margaret's workhouse, where her portrait is still preserved. Her body was
  followed to the grave by the parochial authorities and many of the
  principal inhabitants, while the children sang a hymn before it reached
  its last resting-place."]</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of "Coin."</i>&mdash;What is the etymology of our noun
  and verb <i>coin</i> and <i>to coin</i>? I do not know if I have been
  anticipated, but beg to suggest the following:&mdash;<i>Coin</i>, a piece
  of cornered metal; <i>To coin</i>, the act of cornering such block of
  metal.</p>

  <p>In Cornwall, the blocks of tin, when first run into moulds from the
  smelting furnace, are <i>square</i>; and when the metal is to be fined or
  assayed, the miner's phrase is, that it is to be <i>coined</i>; for the
  <i>corners</i> of the moulded block are <i>cut off</i>, and subjected to
  the <i>assay</i>; and the decree of fineness proved is stamped on the now
  cornerless block&mdash;thereafter called a <i>coin of tin</i>. It is, I
  conceive, by no means a violent supposition that such <i>coins of tin</i>
  were current as money very many ages before either silver, gold, copper,
  bronze, lead, tin, or any other metal moulded, stamped, engraved, or
  fashioned into such coins as we now know had come into use. We know to
  what far-back ages the finding of tin carries us, its find being entirely
  confined to Cornwall; its presence near the surface in an ore readily
  reduced and easily melted making its reduction into the metallic state
  possible in the very rudest state of society and of the arts.</p>

  <p>[See Dr. Richardson for the following derivation:&mdash;"Fr.

<h3>MEDAL AND RELIC OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 293.)</p>

  <p>I possess a cast of this medal as described by your correspondent
  <span class="sc">W. Fraser</span>, but which is a little indistinct in
  some of the letters of its inscriptions. The yew-tree represented on it
  is generally supposed to be that which stood at Cruikston Castle nearly
  Paisley; and its motto "Vires" may perhaps have been intended to denote
  its natural strength and durability. The date of the medal being 1566,
  and Mary's marriage with Lord Darnly having taken place on July 29, 1565,
  the yew-tree may have been introduced to commemorate some incident of
  their courtship, and gives likelihood to the common tradition. I once had
  a small box composed partly of its wood, and of <!-- Page 445 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page445"></a>{445}</span>that of the "Torwood
  Oak" near Stirling, which was presented to me about thirty-five years ago
  by an aged lady, whose property it had been for a long time previously,
  and who placed much value on it as a relic. Though visiting Cruikston
  Castle in early life, I never heard of there being any feeling of
  "superstition" connected with such little objects as the crosses, &amp;c.
  which were long made from the wood of the yew-tree. They are all, I
  think, to be viewed simply as curiosities associated with the historical
  interest of the place, and similar examples are to be found among our
  people in the numerous <i>quaichs</i> (drinking-cups) and other articles
  which have been formed from the "Torwood Oak" that protected the
  illustrious Sir William Wallace from his enemies; from his oak at
  Elderslie, said to have been planted by his hand, two miles to the west
  of Paisley; and lately from such scraps of the old oaken rafters of the
  Glasgow Cathedral as could be obtained in the course of its modern
  repairs.</p>

  <p>As respects the yew-tree immediately concerned, some notices of its
  remains may be found in a work entitled <i>The Severn Delineated</i>, by
  Charles Taylor, Glasgow, 1831, at page 82. The author, who was a very
  curious local antiquary, died in 1837, aged forty-two. As his book is now
  scarce, I may be excused from subjoining rather a long extract, but which
  also throws some light on other particulars of this subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Retreating from Househill (a seat in the vicinity) to Cruikston
  Castle, the country is rich, and the scenery delightful. The castle
  itself might be the subject of volumes, as it has been the theme of many
  a poet, and the subject of many a painter's pencil. Its name is known all
  over the world, or may be so, from the circumstance of its once having
  been the residence of Mary Queen of Scots and Henry Lord Darnly; and
  though the famed yew-tree decks not now the 'hallowed mould,' as the poet
  expresses himself,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Is there an eye that tearless could behold</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>About three years ago a large fragment fell from the south wing of
  this ruin, despite of all the attention Sir John Maywell paid to keep it
  up. The founder of this castle was one De Croc; hence the name Crockston,
  Crocston, or Cruikston. This family (says Crawfurd), failing in ane
  heiress, she was married to Sir Alexander Stewart of Torbolton, second
  son to Walter, the second of that name, Great Stewart of Scotland, and of
  this marriage are descended the families of Darnly and Lorn."</p>

  </div>
  <p>Lady Maywell ordered to be made by an ingenious individual, at
  Pollockshaws, an exact model of the castle, and some table and other
  utensils, which are still in preservation at Pollock. Before its removal,
  many are the snuff-boxes, toddy ladles, &amp;c. that have been made of
  it, and are still in preservation by the curious. The following couplet,
  composed by the late Mr. W. Craig, surgeon, is inscribed on one of these
  ladles, which has seen no little service:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i1">Where Scotland's queen was woo'd."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Another medal of Queen Mary's, of considerable size, of which I have
  seen a cast many years since, contained the following inscriptions:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O God graunt patience in that I suffer vrang."</p>

  <p class="author">G. N.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Fraser's</span> supposed medal is a ryal (or
  possibly a ¾ ryal) of Mary and Henry, commonly known as a Cruickstown
  dollar; from the idea that the tree upon them is a representation of the
  famous yew-tree at Cruickstown Castle. It appears, however, from the
  ordinance for coining these pieces, that the tree is a "palm-tree crowned
  with a shell paddock (lizard) creeping up the stem of the same." The
  motto across the tree is "<span class="scac">DAT GLORIA VIRES</span>."

<h3>EARLY USE OF TIN.&mdash;DERIVATION OF THE NAME
OF BRITAIN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 344.)</p>

  <p>The reply of Dr. Hincks appears to require the following. While
  seeking information upon the first of these matters, I took up one of my
  old school-books, and at the foot of a page found the following note:
  "Britannia is from <i>Barat-anac</i>, the land of tin." I do not
  recollect to have seen it elsewhere; but it appeared to me so apt and
  correct that I adopted it at once.</p>

  <p>That the Shirutana of the Egyptian inscriptions, <!-- Page 446
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page446"></a>{446}</span>or Shairetana,
  will be found to be the same people as the Cirátas of the Hindu Puranas,
  I have little doubt.</p>

  <p>Cirátas is there applied as a name to the people who were afterwards
  known to us as the Ph&oelig;nicians; but that either the Shirutana or the
  Cirátas will be found to have discovered Britain, though they may have
  given it a name, I do not expect. The Cirátas were a people of a later
  age to that of the first inhabitants of Britain. The first inhabitants of
  Britain I call the Celtæ, as I know no other name for them; but there
  seems reason for thinking that this island was visited by an earlier
  tribe, though probably they were of the same race.</p>

  <p>The origin of the Cirátas and first inhabitants of Britain is
  this:&mdash;A powerful monarchy appears to have been established at the
  earliest dawn of history in the country we now call Persia, long before
  there was any Assyrian government, and under this monarchy that country
  was the true centre of population, of knowledge, of languages, and of
  arts. Three distinct races of men appear to have migrated in different
  directions from this their common country. One of these divides into two
  parts, one proceeding to the west, the other to the south-east of the
  place where the division took place. The western party passed through
  Asia Minor, and also by the north of the Black Sea, carrying with it all
  that was then known of the different arts and sciences, until we find the
  descendants at this day in the British Isles. The south-eastern party,
  also, continued its progress to the part now known to us as India, where
  its descendants may be found at this day. Long after the settlement in
  India, various tribes, all proceeding from it, migrated from that country
  to the parts now known to us as Egypt and Syria; and one of these tribes
  was the Cirátas.</p>

  <p>That the Cirátas, Shirutana, or Ph&oelig;nicians, call them as you
  may, were the first who passed the Pillar of Hercules in ships on their
  way to obtain tin here at first-hand, is almost certain; and that the
  western party, as described above, had broken ground to supply it long
  before their customers came for it, is scarcely less so. They all had a
  common origin, and used nearly the same language, religion, and laws.</p>

  <p>My Query has brought out a highly satisfactory elucidation of the
  origin of the term <i>Britain</i>; and this, looking at the position in
  which that term stood on the day the last Number of "N. &amp; Q." was
  published is by no means a slight acquisition. I now leave it.</p>

  <p>Lowndes speaks of a large paper impression in quarto of this same

  besides twenty-two containing dedication, table, &amp;c. Prefixed is a

  of Wales. Sturt likewise published a set of fifty-five historical cuts

  <p>1794. London. Published by J. Good and E. Harding, with plates after

  <p>Lowndes also mentions "Illustrations to the Book of Common Prayer by
  Richard Westall, London, 1813, 8 vo. (proofs) 4to.," and "Twelve
  illustrations to ditto, engraved by John Scott, from designs by Burney
  and Thurston, royal 8vo."</p>

  <p>I have reserved for more particular description two editions in my own
  possession:&mdash;One is a small 8vo., ruled with red lines: "In the
  Savoy, printed by the assignees of John Bill and Christopher Barker,
  Printers to the King's Most Excellent Majesty, 1667." It contains
  fifty-nine plates: these are identical with those in the <i>Antiquitates
  Christianæ</i>, or Bishop Taylor's <i>Life of Christ</i>, and Cave's
  <i>Lives of the Apostles</i> (folio editions), which, if I mistake not,
  were engraved by William Faithorn. The Act of Uniformity is given in
  black-letter. The Ordinal is wanting. The three State Services are not
  enumerated in the Table of Contents, but are added at the end of the
  book. The Old Version of the Psalms (with its usual quaint title), a
  tract of 104 pp., is appended: "London: printed by Thos. Newcomb for the
  Company of Stationers, 1671." The other edition is a 12mo.: "London,
  printed by Charles Bill and the Executrix of Thomas Newcomb deceased,
  Printers to the Queen's Most Excellent Majesty, 1708" (ruled with red
  lines). In the frontispiece is represented a female figure kneeling with
  a prayer book open before her: an angel <!-- Page 447 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page447"></a>{447}</span>in the air holds a
  scroll, on which is inscribed, "The Liturgy of the Church of England,
  adorned with fifty-five historical cuts, P. La Vergne del., M. Van der
  Gucht sc." Beneath the picture, "Sold by Robt. Whitledge at the Bible in
  Ave Maria Lane, near Stationers' Hall."</p>

  <p>Some of the cuts are very curious, as No. 16., which represents the
  Devil (adorned with a crown, sceptre, and tail) standing on the top of a
  high conical rock, and our Blessed Lord at a little distance from him.
  The appearance and attitude of the Apostles are somewhat grotesque. One
  of the best is St. Philip (No. 39.), who is represented as a wrinkled,
  bearded old man, contemplating a crucifix in his hand.</p>

  <p>No. 51. is a picture of Guy Fawkes approaching the Parliament House,
  with a lantern in his hand. A large eye is depicted in the clouds above,
  which sheds a stream of light on the hand of the conspirator. No. 52. is
  "The Martyrdom of King Charles I." No. 53. "The Restoration of Monarchy
  and King Charles II." A number of cavaliers on horseback, with their
  conical hats and long tresses, occupy the foreground of this picture; the
  army appears in the background. This is the last, though the scroll
  advertises fifty-five cuts.</p>

  <p>The Prefaces and Calendar are printed in very small bad type. The four
  State Services are enumerated in the Table of Contents. After the State
  Services follow, "At the Healing;" the Thirty-nine Articles, and a Table
  of Kindred and Affinity. This edition neither contains the Ordinal nor a
  metrical version of the Psalms. Notwithstanding the date on the
  title-page, <i>King George</i> is prayed for throughout the book, except
  in the service "For the Eighth Day of March," when Queen Anne's name
  occurs.</p>

  <p>Of the modern pictorial editions of the Book of Common Prayer may be
  mentioned that of Charles Knight "illustrated by nearly seven hundred
  beautiful woodcuts by Jackson, from drawings by Harvey, and six
  illuminated titles; with Explanatory Notes by the Rev. H. Stebbing,"
  royal 8vo., London, 1838; reprinted in 1846. That of Murray, "illuminated
  by Owen Jones, and illustrated with engravings from the works of the
  great masters," royal 8vo., London, 1845; reprinted in 1850 in med. 8vo.
  That of Whittaker in 12mo. and 8vo., "with notes and illuminations." The
  last, and by far the best, pictorial edition is that of J.&nbsp;H. Parker of
  Oxford, "with fifty illustrations; selected from the finest examples of
  the early Italian and modern German schools, by the Rev. H.&nbsp;J. Rose and
  Rev. J.&nbsp;W. Burgon."</p>

<h3>YEW-TREES IN CHURCHYARDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 346.)</p>

  <p>This has long been to me a vexed question, and I fear that none of
  your correspondents have given a satisfactory answer.</p>

  <p>I have seen in London sprigs of yew and palm willow offered for sale
  before Palm Sunday. At this period they may, I think, be always found in
  Covent Garden Market. I saw them last year also in the greengrocers'
  shops at Brighton. To me these are evident traces of an old custom of
  using the yew as well as the willow. The origin is to be found in the
  Jewish custom of carrying "branches of palm-trees, and boughs of <i>thick
  trees</i>, and willows from the brook" (Leviticus xxiii. 39, 40.).</p>

  <p>Wordsworth alludes to this in his sonnet on seeing a procession at
  Chamouny:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The Hebrews thus carrying in joyful state</p>
      <p>Thick boughs of palm and willows from the brook,</p>
      <p>March'd round the altar&mdash;to commemorate</p>
      <p>How, when their course they from the desert took,</p>
      <p>Guided by signs which ne'er the sky forsook,</p>
      <p>They lodged in leafy tents and cabins low,</p>
      <p>Green boughs were borne."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>A Voyage from Leith to Lapland</i>, 1851, vol. i. p. 132., there
  is an account of the funeral of the poet Oehlenschläger. The author
  states,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The entire avenue was strewn, according to the old Scandinavian
  custom, with evergreen boughs of fir, and bunches of fir and box, mingled
  in some instances with artificial flowers. It is customary at all
  funerals to strew evergreens before the door of the house where the body
  lies, but it is only for some very distinguished person indeed they are
  strewn all the way to the burial place."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Forby, in his <i>East Anglican Vocabulary</i>, says it is a
  superstitious notion that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"If you bring yew into the house at Christmas amongst the evergreens
  used to dress it, you will have a death in the family before the end of
  the year."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I believe the yew will be found generally on the south side of the
  church, but always near the principal entrance, easy of access for the
  procession on Palm Sunday, and perhaps for funerals, and that it was used
  as a substitute for the palm, and coupled with "the willow from the
  brook," hence called the palm willow.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">A Holt White</span>.</p>

  <p>P. S.&mdash;I cannot agree with your correspondent <span
  class="sc">J.&nbsp;G. Cumming</span>, that the yew is one of "our few
  evergreens." I doubt our having in England any native evergreen but the
  holly.</p>

  <p>The etymology of the name of the yew-tree clearly shows that it was
  not planted in churchyards as an emblem of evil, but one of immortality.
  The name of the tree in Celtic is <i>jubar</i>, pronounced <i>yewar</i>,
  <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> "the evergreen head." The town of <!-- Page 448 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page448"></a>{448}</span>Newry in Ireland took
  its name from two yew-trees which St. Patrick planted:
  <i>A-Niubaride</i>, pronounced <i>A-Newery</i>, <i>i. e.</i> "the
  yew-trees," which stood until Cromwell's time, when some soldiers
  ruthlessly cut them down.</p>

  <p>In the Note by <span class="sc">Mr. J. G. Cumming</span>, a derivation
  is evidently required for the English word <i>yeoman</i>, which he
  suggests is taken from "yokeman." Yeoman is from <i>e&#x14D;</i>,
  pronounced <i>yo</i>, <i>i. e.</i> free, worthy, respectable, as opposed
  to the terms <i>villein</i>, serf, &amp;c.; so that yeoman means a
  freeman, a respectable person.</p>

<h3>OSBORN FAMILY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 270.)</p>

  <p>Mr. H. T. Griffith asks where may any pedigree of the <i>Osborne</i>
  family, previous to Edward Osborne, the ancestor of the Dukes of Leeds,
  be seen. In reply, I am in possession of large collections relating to
  the Norman Osbornes, from whom I have reasons to believe him to have been
  descended. Those Osbornes can be proved to have been settled in certain
  of the midland counties of England from the time of the attainder and
  downfall of the son of William Fitzosborne, Earl of Hereford and premier
  peer, down to a comparatively late period. A branch of them was possessed
  of the manor of Kelmarsh in Northamptonshire; and their pedigree,
  beginning in 1461, may be seen in Whalley's <i>Northamptonshire</i>: but
  this is necessarily very imperfect, on account of the author's want of
  access to documents which have subsequently been opened to the
  public.</p>

  <p>I may here notice that an inexcusable error has been committed and
  repeated in several of the collections of records published by the
  Parliamentary Commission, who have, in numerous instances, and without
  any warrant, interpreted <i>Osb.</i> of the MSS. as "Osbert." Thus they
  have deprived <i>Fitzosborne</i>, Bishop of Exeter (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1102), of some of his manors, and within his own
  diocese, and conferred them on <i>Osbert the Bishop</i>, although there
  never was a bishop of that name in England. I took the liberty of
  pointing out this error to one of the chief editors concerned in these
  works; but as he has taken no notice of my observations, I must infer
  that he thinks it most prudent to excite no farther inquiry.</p>

  <p>The <i>Osborns</i>, now so numerous in London, appear to have come
  from the Danish stem from which the Norman branch was originally derived.
  Their number, which has increased even beyond the ordinary ratio of the
  population, may perhaps be dated from the wife of one of them who (temp.
  Jac. I.) had twenty-four sons, and was interred in old St. Paul's.</p>

  <p>I shall be very happy to afford any assistance in my power to the
  gentleman who has occasioned these remarks.</p>

<h3>LADIES' ARMS BORNE IN A LOZENGE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 37. 83. 277. 329.)</p>

  <p>I broached a theory with a concluding remark that it would give me
  great pleasure to see one more reasonable take its place. I fear that, if
  all your readers anxious to clear up an obscure point in an interesting
  science take no more trouble than P.&nbsp;P., we shall find ourselves no <!--
  Page 449 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page449"></a>{449}</span>nearer our object in the middle of your
  eightieth volume than we are now in your eighth.</p>

  <p>What P. P. is pleased to term the "routine" reason is after all but
  one among many, and is not better substantiated than some of the others
  quoted by me; for though the lozenge has a "supposed" resemblance to the
  distaff or fusil, heraldically it is but a supposed one, and by most
  writers the difference is very distinctly indicated.</p>

  <p>Boyer says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A fusil is a bearing in heraldry made in the form of a spindle, with
  its yarn or thread wound about it. <i>Fusils are longer than
  lozenges</i>, and taper or pointed at both ends."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same author thus describes a lozenge:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Rhimbus, in geometry, is a figure of four equal and parallel sides,
  but not rectangular."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Robson says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Fusil, a kind of spindle used in spinning. Its formation should be
  particularly attended to, <i>as few painters or engravers make a
  sufficient distinction between the fusil and lozenge</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Nisbet describes a lozenge to be&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A figure that has equal sides and unequal angles, as the quarry of a
  glass window placed erect pointways."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Latins say, 'Lozengæ factæ sunt ad modum lozangiorum in vitreis.'
  Heralds tell us that their use in armories came from the pavement of
  marble stones of churches, fine palaces and houses, cut after the form of
  lozenges, which pavings the French and Italians call loze and the
  Spaniards <i>loza</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sylvester de Petra-Sancta of the lozenge says much the same:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Scutulas oxigonias scu acutangulus erectas, et quasi gradiles,
  referri debere ad latericias et antiquas domus olim, viz. Nobilium quia
  vulgus, et infamiæ sortis homines, intra humiles casus, vet antra
  inhabitantur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of the fusil Nisbet writes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The fusil is another Rhombular figure like the lozenge, but more long
  than broad, and its upper and lower points are more acute than the two
  side points."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>He adds that:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Chassanus and others make their sides round, as in his description of
  them: 'Fusæ sunt acutæ in superiore et inferiore partibus, et rotundæ ex
  utroque latere;' which description has occasioned some English heralds,
  when so painted or engraven, to call them millers' picks, as Sir John
  Boswell, in his <i>Concords of Armory</i>, and others, to call them
  weavers' shuttles."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Menestrier says of lozenges:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lozange est une figure de quatre pointes, dont deux sont un peu plus
  étendues que les autres, et assise sur une de ces pointes. C'est le Rhomb
  des mathématiciens, et les quarreaux des vitres ordinaires en ont la
  figure."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Of fusils:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Fusées sont plus étendues en longue que les lozanges, et affilées en
  point comme les fuseaux. Elles sont pièces d'architecture où l'on se sert
  pour ornement de fusées et de pesons."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The celebrated <i>Boke of St. Albans</i> (1486) thus describes the
  difference between a lozenge and fusil:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Knaw ye y<sup>e</sup> differans betwix ffusillis and losyng.
  Wherefore it is to be knaw that ffusillis ar euermore long, also fusyllis
  ar strattyr ouerwart in the baly then ar mascules. And mascules ar larger
  ou'wartt in the baly, and shorter in length than be fusyllis."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The mascle is afterwards explained to be the lozenge pierced.
  Again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And ye most take thys for a general enformacion and instruccion that
  certanli losyng eu'more stand upright ... and so withowte dowte we have
  the differans of the foresayd signes, that is to wete of mascules and
  losynges."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dallaway, an elegant writer on Heraldry, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Of the lozenge the following extraordinary description is given in a
  MS. of Glover, 'Lozenga est pars vitri in vitrea fenestra.' But it may be
  more satisfactory to observe that the lozenge, with its diminutive, are
  given to females instead of an escocheon for the insertion of their
  armorial bearings, one of which is supposed to have been a cushion of
  that shape, and the other is evidently the spindle used in spinning; both
  demonstrative of the sedentary employments of women. On a very splendid
  brass for Eleanor, relict of Thomas of Woodstocke, who died 1384, she is
  delineated as resting her head upon two cushions, the upper of which is
  placed lozenge-wise."&mdash;P. 140.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The above is taken from his <i>Miscellaneous Observations on Heraldic
  Ensigns</i>, the following from the body of his great work:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Females being heirs, or conveying feodal lordships to their husbands,
  had, as early as the thirteenth century, the privilege of armorial seals.
  The variations were progressive and frequent; at first the female effigy
  had the kirtle or inner garment emblazoned, or held the escocheon over
  her head, or in her right hand; then three escocheons met in the centre,
  or four were joined at their bases, if the alliance admitted of so many.
  Dimidiation, accollation, and impalement succeeded each other at short
  intervals. But the modern practice of placing the arms of females upon a
  lozenge appears to have originated about the middle of the fourteenth
  century, when we have an instance of five lozenges conjoined upon one
  seal; that of the heir female in the centre impaling the arms of her
  husband, and surrounded by those of her ancestors."&mdash;P. 400.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I think this quotation from so learned a writer goes far towards
  settling the whole question. I confess myself willing to have my theory
  placed second to this, while I must discard the "distaff" <!-- Page 450
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page450"></a>{450}</span>notion, unless
  better substantiated than by the French saying from their Salique law,
  which I here give for P.&nbsp;P.'s information: "Nunquam corona a lance
  transibit ad fusum." I am willing to admit the antiquity of this notion;
  for while the shape of the man's shield is traced by Sylvanus Morgan to
  Adam's spade, he takes the woman's from Eve's spindle!</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"When Adam delved, and Eve span,</p>
      <p>Who was then the gentleman?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In Geoffry Chaucer's time the lozenge appears to have been an ornament
  worn by heralds in their dress or crown. In describing the habit of one,
  he says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"They crowned were as kinges</p>
      <p>With crowns wrought full of lozenges</p>
      <p>And many ribbons and many fringes."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>As for the difference between the lozenge and fusil, I could multiply
  opinions and examples, but hope those given will be sufficient.</p>

  <p>I cannot conclude these few hasty remarks without expressing a wish
  that one of your correspondents in particular would take up this subject,
  to handle which in a masterly manner, his position is a guaranty of his
  ability. I refer to the gentleman holding the office of York Herald.</p>

<h3>THE MYRTLE BEE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 173.)</p>

  <p>From a very early period, and throughout life, I have been accustomed
  to shooting, and well remember the bird in question, but whether the term
  was local or general, I am unable to state, never having met with it save
  in one locality; and many years have elapsed since I saw one, although in
  the habit of frequenting the neighbourhood where it was originally to be
  seen. I attribute its disappearance to local causes. I met with it during
  a series of years, ending about twenty-five years since, at which period
  I lost sight of it. It was to be met with during the autumn and winter in
  bogs scattered over with bog myrtle, on Chobham and the adjacent common;
  I never met with it elsewhere. It is solitary. I am unacquainted with its
  food, and only in a single instance had I ever one in my hand. Its tongue
  is pointed, sharp, and appearing capable of penetration. Its colour
  throughout dusky light blue, slightly tinged with yellow about the vent.
  Tail about one inch, being rather long in proportion to the body, causing
  the wings to appear forward, with a miniature pheasant-like appearance as
  it flew, or rather darted, from bush to bush, with amazing quickness, its
  wings moving with rapidity, straight in its flight, keeping near the
  ground, appearing loth to wing, never passing an intervening bush if ever
  so near; and I never saw one fly over eight or ten yards, and never wing
  a second time, which induced our dogs (using a sporting phrase) to puzzle
  them, causing a belief that they were in most instances trodden under the
  water and grass in which the myrtle grew, and which nothing but a dog
  could approach. I never saw one sitting or light on a branch of the
  myrtle, but invariably flying from the <i>base</i> of one plant to that
  of another. I am not aware that any cabinet contains a preserved
  specimen, or that the bird has ever been noticed by any naturalist as a
  British or foreign bird.</p>

  <p>Should W. R. D. S. covet farther information as to the probable cause
  of its disappearance, and my never having met with it elsewhere, perhaps
  he will favour me with his address. I cannot think the bird extinct.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN JOHN DAVIS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 385.)</p>

  <p>The earliest memoir of captain John Davis, the celebrated arctic
  navigator, is that given by the reverend John Prince in his <span
  class="sc">Danmonii orientales illustres</span>, <i>or the worthies of
  Devon</i>, Exeter, 1701, folio. It is, however, erroneous and defective
  in important particulars, and has misled some eminent writers, as
  Campbell, Eyriès, Barrow, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Despite the assertions of master Prince, I <i>question</i> if captain
  Davis married a daughter of sir John Fulford; I am <i>sure</i> he was not
  the first pilot who conducted the Hollanders to the East-Indies; I am
  sure the journal of the voyage is not printed in Hakluyt; I am sure the
  narrative of his voyage with sir Edward Michelborne is neither dedicated
  to the earl of Essex nor printed in Hakluyt; I am sure he did not write
  the <i>Rutter, or brief directions for sailing into the East-Indies</i>;
  I am sure he wrote two works of which Prince says nothing; I am sure he
  did not make <i>five</i> voyages to the East-Indies; and I am sure, to
  omit other oversights, that he did not "return home safe again." To the
  latter point I shall now confine myself.</p>

  <p>In 1604 king James, regardless of the charter held by the East-India
  company, granted a license to sir Edward Michelborne, one of his
  gentlemen-pensioners, to discover and trade with the "countries and
  domynions of Cathaia, China, Japan," &amp;c. This license, preserved in
  the Rolls-chapel, is dated the twenty-fifth of June. On the fifth of
  December sir Edward set sail from Cowes with the Tiger, a ship of 240
  tons, and a pinnace&mdash;captain Davis being, as I conceive, the
  <i>second</i> in command. In December 1605, being near the island of
  Bintang, they fell in with a junk of 70 tons, carrying ninety Japanese,
  most of them <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page451"></a>{451}</span>"in too gallant a habit for saylers:" in
  fact, they were pirates! The unfortunate result shall now be stated in
  the words of the <i>pirate</i> Michelborne:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Vpon mutuall courtesies with gifts and feastings betweene vs,
  sometimes fiue and twentie or sixe and twentie of their chiefest came
  aboord: whereof I vould not suffer aboue sixe to have weapons. Their was
  neuer the like number of our men aboord their iunke. I willed captaine
  John Dauis in the morning [the twenty-seventh of December] to possesse
  himselfe of their weapons, and to put the companie before mast, and to
  leave some guard on their weapons, while they searched in the rice,
  doubting that by searching and finding that which would dislike them,
  they might suddenly set vpon my men, and put them to the sword: as the
  sequell prooued. Captaine Dauis being beguiled with their humble
  semblance, would not possesse himselfe of their weapons, though I sent
  twice of purpose from my shippe to will him to doe it. They passed all
  the day, my men searching in the rice, and they looking on: at the
  sunne-setting, after long search and nothing found, saue a little storax
  and beniamin: they seeing oportunitie, and talking to the rest of their
  companie which were in my ship, being neere to their iunke, they
  resolued, at a watch-word betweene them, to set vpon vs resolutely in
  both ships. This being concluded, they suddenly killed and droue
  ouer-boord, all my men that were in their ship; and those which were
  aboord my ship sallied out of my cabbin, where they were put, with such
  weapons as they had, finding certaine targets in my cabbin, and other
  things that they vsed as weapons. My selfe being aloft on the decke,
  knowing what was likely to follow, leapt into the waste, where, with the
  boate swaines, carpenter and some few more, wee kept them vnder the
  halfe-decke. At their first comming forth of the cabbin, they met captain
  Dauis comming out of the gun-roome, whom they pulled into the cabbin, and
  giuing him sixe or seuen mortall wounds, they thrust him out of the
  cabbin before them. His wounds were so mortall, that he dyed assoone as
  he came into the waste."&mdash;Purchas, i. 137.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Clouds in Photographs.</i>&mdash;I wish one of your photographic
  correspondents would inform me, how <i>clouds</i> can be put into
  photographs taken on paper? Mr. Buckle's photographs all contain
  <i>clouds</i>?</p>

  <p>"<i>The Stereoscope considered in relation to the Philosophy of
  Binocular Vision</i>" is the title of a small pamphlet written by a
  frequent contributor to this journal, Mr. C. <span class="sc">Mansfield
  Ingleby</span>, in which he has "attempted to sketch out such
  modifications of the theory of double vision as appear to him to be
  entailed on the rationale of the stereoscope." The corroboration thus
  indirectly afforded to the principles of Sir William Hamilton's
  <i>Philosophy of Perception</i> has induced <span class="sc">Mr.
  Ingleby</span> to dedicate his word to that distinguished metaphysician.
  The essay will, we have no doubt, be perused with great interest by many
  of our photographic friends, for whose gratification we shall borrow its
  concluding paragraph.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In conclusion we must not forget to acknowledge our obligations to
  the photographic art, not merely as one of the most suggestive results of
  natural science, but as a means of the widest and soundest utility. To
  antiquaries the services of photography have a unique value, for, by
  perpetuating in the form of negatives those monuments of nature and art
  which, though exempt from common accident, are still subject to gradual
  decay from time, it places in the hands of us all microscopically exact
  antitypes of objects which, from change or distance, are otherwise
  inaccessible. To the artist they afford the means of facilitating the
  otherwise laborious, and often mechanical, task of drawing in detail from
  nature and from the human figure.</p>

  <p>"To the physician, to the naturalist, and to the man of science, the
  uses of photography are various and important, and already the
  discoveries which have been directly due to this modern art are of
  stupendous utility.</p>

  <p>"To the metaphysician, its uses may be sufficiently gleaned from the
  applications considered in the preceding pages. But to all these classes
  of men the photographic art derives its chief glory from its application
  to the stereoscope; and if, for elucidating the principles of vision by
  means of this application, we have in any degree given a stimulus to the
  practice and improvement of the photographic processes, our pains have
  been happily and fruitfully bestowed."</p>

  <p><i>Muller's Processes.</i>&mdash;Would you inform me, through the
  medium of "N. &amp; Q.," what manufacture of paper is best adapted to the
  two processes of Mr. Muller? I have tried several: with some I find that
  the combination of their starch with the iodide of iron causes a dark
  precipitate upon the face of the paper; and with those papers prepared
  with size, there appears to me great difficulty (in his improved process
  after the paper is moistened with aceto-nitrate of silver) to procure an
  equal distribution of the iodide over its surface, as it invariably dries
  or runs off parts of the paper, or is repelled by spots of size on the
  paper when dipped in the iodide of iron bath.&mdash;A reply to the
  foregoing question would greatly oblige</p>

  <p><i>Positives on Glass.</i>&mdash;Sometimes, when your sitter is gone,
  and you hold your portrait up to the light to examine its density, you
  find in the face and other parts which are dark, so viewed, minute
  <i>transparent</i> specks, scarcely bigger than a pin's point. When the
  picture is backed with black lacquer, you have consequently small
  <i>black</i> spots, which deform the positive, especially when viewed
  through a lens of short focus. A friend of mine <!-- Page 452 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page452"></a>{452}</span>cures this defect very
  easily. After having applied the amber varnish, he stops out the spots
  with a little oil-paint that matches the lights of the picture; of course
  the paint is put upon the varnished side of the glass. When the paint is
  dry, the black lacquer is carried over the whole as usual.</p>

  <p><i>Nursery Rhymes</i> (Vol. viii., p. 455.).&mdash;I would suggest to
  L. that a consideration of <i>rhymes</i> may sometimes indicate, by the
  change in the pronunciation, the antiquity of the verse e.g.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hush aby, baby, on the green <i>bough</i>,</p>
      <p>When the wind blows the cradle will <i>rock</i>,</p>
      <p>And when the bough breaks," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here, according to modern pronunciation, the rhymes of the first
  couplet are imperfect, so that it was probably composed in the Saxon era,
  or while the word <i>bough</i> was still pronounced <i>bog</i> or
  <i>bock</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Milton's Widow</i> (Vol. vii., p. 596.; Vol. viii., pp. 12. 134.
  200.).&mdash;Reading up my arrears of "N. &amp; Q.," which a long absence
  from England has caused to accumulate, I find frequent inquiries made for
  some information which I once promised, relative to Milton's widow. I
  fear that your correspondents on this subject have formed an exaggerated
  idea of the importance of the expected note, and that they will see but a
  "ridiculus mus" after all. As I have no means at hand at the present
  moment wherewith to attempt to elucidate the Minshull genealogy, I shall
  content myself by simply sending my original notes, namely, brief
  abstracts of the wills of Thomas and Nathan Paget preserved at Doctors'
  Commons.</p>

  <p>Thomas Paget, minister of the gospel at Stockport, in Cheshire, makes
  his will May 23, 1660; mentions his three daughters Dorothy, Elizabeth,
  and Mary; and leaves estates at different places in Shropshire to his two
  sons, Dr. Nathan and Thomas, whom he appoints his executors. He entreats
  <i>his cousin Minshull, apothecarie in Manchester</i>, to be overseer of
  his will, which was proved October 16, 1660.</p>

  <p>[I have before (Vol. v., p. 327.) shown the connexion between the
  Pagets and Manchester.]</p>

  <p>Nathan Paget, Doctor in Medicine, will dated January 7, 1678, was then
  living in the parish of St. Stephen's, Coleman Street, London, leaves
  certain estates, and his house in London where he resided, to his brother
  Thomas Paget, clerk. Bequests to his cousin John Goldsmith of the Middle
  Temple, gent., and <i>his cousin Elizabeth Milton</i>, to the Society of
  Physicians, and the poor of the parish of St. Stephen's. Will proved
  January 15, 1678.</p>

  <p>I have omitted to note <i>what</i> the bequests were. I will only add,
  that some time ago I dropped my <i>alias</i> of <span

  prevent the Evil One from stealing them, a crime of which he had been
  repeatedly guilty. The proof of this is found in the stone-floor, where
  his foot-marks are impressed, and still show the direction of his march:
  they also teach us the important fact, that the feet of his tenebrious

  which of the libraries MS. volumes of heraldry and genealogy ought to be
  found; he should then apply, either through some master of arts, or with
  a proper letter of introduction in his hand, to the librarian for leave
  to search the volumes. He will find that generally every facility is
  afforded him which the safe keeping of historical evidences allows. He
  will do well to select term-time for the period of making a search; and
  before seeking admission to a college librarian, it will be found
  convenient to both parties for him to give a day's notice, by letter or
  card, to the librarian, who has often occupations and engagements that
  cannot always be got rid of at the call of a chance visitor.</p>

  printed with movable metal types before 1435. One of these, <i>Aelii
  Donati Grammaticæ Latinæ Fragmenta duo</i>, was printed before 1425, and
  the writer of the catalogue adds in his notes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ipsos typos, quibus hæ lamellæ sunt excusæ, fuisse <i>mobiles</i>,
  cum nonnullæ literæ inversæ evidenter testantur, tum omnium
  expertissimorum typographorum reique typographicæ peritissimorum
  arbitrûm, qui has lacinias contemplati sunt, unanima et constans
  affirmavit sententia. Quin et <i>fusos</i> eos esse perhibuerunt plurimi,
  et in his Koningius, magno quamvis studio negaverat typorum ligneorum
  mobilium acerrimus propugnator Meermannus."</p>

  <p><i>Oaken Tombs</i> (Vol. vii., p. 528.; Vol. viii., p. 179.).&mdash;In
  the chancel of Brancepeth Church, co. Durham, are oaken effigies of a
  Lord and Lady Neville, of which the following is a description. The
  figure of the man is in a coat of mail, the hands elevated with
  gauntlets, wearing his casque, which rests on a bull's or buffalo's head,
  a collar round his neck studded with gems, and on the breast a shield
  with the arms of Neville. The female figure has a high crowned bonnet,
  and the mantle is drawn close over the feet, which rest on two dogs
  couchant. The tomb is ornamented with small figures of ecclesiastics at
  prayer, but is without inscription. Leland (<i>Itin.</i>, i. 80.)
  says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the paroche church of Saint Brandon, at Branspeth, be dyvers
  tumbes of the Nevilles. In the quire is a high tumbe, of one of them
  porturid with his wife. This Neville lakkid heires male, wherapoan great
  concertation rose betwixt the next heire male, and one the
  Gascoynes."</p>

  additional light on the controversy as to "fogie," I may add that for a
  long period of years I have heard it applied only to the discharged
  invalided pensioners of the army. On a late Queen's birthday review on
  the <i>Green</i>, the boys and girls were in ecstasies at seeing the "old
  fogies" dressed out in new suits. It is very often spoken derisively to a
  thick-headed stupid person, but which cannot determine accurately its
  primary signification.</p>

<h3>Notes on Books, Etc.</h3>

  <p>The noble President of the Society of Antiquaries is fast bringing to
  completion the cheaper and revised edition of his <i>History of England
  from the Peace of Utrecht to the Peace of Versailles</i>, 1713-1783. The
  sixth volume, which is now before us, embraces the eventful six years
  1774-1780, which saw the commencement of the great struggle with America,
  which ended in the independence of the United States. In this, as in his
  preceding volumes, the new materials which Lord Mahon has been so
  fortunate as to collect from the family papers of the representatives of
  the political leaders of the period, and which he has inserted in his
  appendix, contribute very materially to the value and importance of his
  history.</p>

  <p><i>Cheshire; its Historical and Literary Associations, illustrated in
  a series of Biographical Sketches;</i> and <i>The Cheshire and Lancashire
  Historical Collector</i>, a small 8vo. sheet originally issued every
  month, but now every fortnight, in consequence of increase of materials,
  and the great encouragement which the undertaking has received, are two
  contributions towards Cheshire topography, local history, bibliography,
  &amp;c., for which the good men of the Palatinate are indebted to the
  zeal of Mr. T. Worthington Barlow, of the Society of Gray's Inn.</p>

  <p>It is always a subject of gratification to us when we see cheap yet
  handsome reprints of our standard authors; for no better proof can be
  given of the increase among us not only of a reading public, but of a
  public who are disposed to read well. It is therefore with no small
  pleasure that we have received from Mr. Routledge copies of his five
  shilling edition of <i>The Canterbury Tales, by Geoffrey Chaucer, from
  the Text, and with the Notes and Glossary of Thomas Tyrwhitt, condensed
  and arranged under the Text</i>. It is obvious that considerable labour
  has been taken by the editor in its preparation, for he has not contented
  himself with merely transferring the contents of Tyrwhitt's Notes and
  Glossary to their proper places beneath the text; but has availed himself
  of the labours of Messrs. Craik, Saunders, Sir H. Nicolas, and our able
  correspondent A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B., to give completeness to what is a very useful
  edition of old Dan Chaucer's masterpiece. We have to thank the same
  publisher for a corresponding edition of Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i>;
  so that no lover of those two glorious old poets need any longer want a
  cheap and compact edition of them.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>History of the
  Guillotine, revised from the Quarterly Review</i>, by the Right Hon.
  J.&nbsp;W. Croker, which forms the new part of Murray's <i>Railway <!-- Page
  456 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page456"></a>{456}</span>Reading</i>, is not only valuable as a
  <i>précis</i> of all that is known upon this very obscure subject, but
  for all its illustration of the difficulty of arriving at historical
  truth.&mdash;<i>A Love Story; being the History of the Courtship and
  Marriage of Dr. Dove of Doncaster</i>, that delightful episode in
  Southey's most delightful book, <i>The Doctor</i>, forms Part L. of
  Longman's <i>Traveller's Library</i>.&mdash;<i>The First Italian Book</i>
  appears a very successful attempt on the part of Signor Pifferi and Mr.
  Dawson W. Turner to furnish a companion to the <i>First French Book</i>
  of that accomplished scholar, the late Rev. T.&nbsp;K. Arnold.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>
